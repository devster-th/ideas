# File & version handing

Ideas about how the file name and the version relates to each other

    //file in production mode 
    root/module/program.js

    //file in dev mode
    root/program1.js

    //when we release new version we may put in a directory
    //so we may put the version in the directory name while maintaining the same name in that directory like
    
    root/program2/program.js & other files
